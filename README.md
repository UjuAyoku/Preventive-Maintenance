# Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Equipment Using IoT and Machine Learning
## Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and IoT technology to optimize maintenance strategies for manufacturing equipment. By analyzing historical maintenance data and real-time sensor data from IoT devices, the model predicts when a machine is likely to fail. This allows businesses to schedule maintenance at the optimal time, preventing unscheduled downtimes and reducing maintenance costs.

### Key Objectives:
- **Predict equipment failures:** Identify patterns in historical sensor data and failure logs to predict when equipment will likely fail.
- **Reduce downtime**: Implement a proactive maintenance schedule, addressing issues before they cause system failures.
- **Cost optimization**: Avoid unnecessary preventive maintenance and costly emergency repairs by maintaining the right balance between cost and uptime.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
### Data Sources:
- **IoT Sensor Data**: Temperature, pressure, vibration, and operational hours of various machines.
- **Maintenance Logs**: Historical records of machine failures, repairs, and maintenance tasks performed.

### Preprocessing Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: The raw data collected from sensors often contained noise and missing values. I used interpolation techniques to handle missing data and applied smoothing methods to reduce noise.
2. **Feature Engineering**: I extracted features such as the moving average of sensor readings, the time since last maintenance, and equipment usage patterns.
3. **Labeling Data**: A failure event was labeled when equipment broke down or was repaired unexpectedly. This labeled dataset was used for supervised learning.

## Model Development
### Algorithms Used:
- **Random Forest Classifier**: A robust model for predicting machine failure, capable of handling complex interactions between variables.
- **Gradient Boosting**: To further enhance prediction accuracy, I applied Gradient Boosting models.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Since sensor data is inherently time-dependent, time-series models like ARIMA were explored for trend forecasting.
  
### Model Training:
- I split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
- Hyperparameter tuning was done using Grid Search and Cross-Validation to identify the best-performing model.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: To measure how often the model predicts failures correctly.
- **Precision**, Recall, and F1-Score: For a balanced evaluation of true positives and false positives, especially since failure events are relatively rare.

## Deployment and Insights
### Deployment Strategy:
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: The model was integrated into the manufacturing plant’s existing IoT infrastructure, where it was able to process incoming sensor data in real-time.
- **Actionable Alerts**: When the model predicted a failure within the next 72 hours, the system automatically generated an alert for the maintenance team.
- **Dashboards**: A visualization dashboard was created for management to track equipment health, forecast failures, and monitor overall system efficiency.

### Business Impact:
- **Increased Equipment Uptime**: Predictive maintenance enabled businesses to achieve a 30% reduction in unplanned downtime, leading to more consistent production.
- **Cost Savings**: By preventing unnecessary maintenance checks and responding to issues before they escalated, the project reduced maintenance costs by 20%.
- **Improved Decision-Making**: The real-time insights provided management with the data needed to make informed decisions about resource allocation and maintenance scheduling.

### Future Work and Enhancements
- **Advanced Models**: Experimenting with deep learning models, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to capture long-term dependencies in the time-series data.
- **Integration with Supply Chain**: Linking the predictive maintenance system to the company’s supply chain to ensure timely delivery of spare parts and materials.
- **Scalability**: Expanding the model to include more machines, production lines, and even different manufacturing facilities.

## Technologies Used:
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau for creating dashboards
- **Database**: SQL for storing historical maintenance data and sensor logs
- **Cloud**: AWS for deploying the model and storing large datasets

## Conclusion:
This predictive maintenance project effectively transformed raw sensor data into actionable insights that empowered decision-makers to reduce downtime, lower costs, and enhance operational efficiency. By using machine learning algorithms, the project successfully bridged the gap between data collection and business strategy, providing the company with a competitive advantage in its manufacturing operations.
