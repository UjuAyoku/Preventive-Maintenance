# Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Equipment Using IoT and Machine Learning
## Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning and IoT technology to optimize maintenance strategies for manufacturing equipment. By analyzing historical maintenance data and real-time sensor data from IoT devices, the model predicts when a machine is likely to fail. This allows businesses to schedule maintenance at the optimal time, preventing unscheduled downtimes and reducing maintenance costs.

### Key Objectives:
- **Predict equipment failures:** Identify patterns in historical sensor data and failure logs to predict when equipment will likely fail.
- **Reduce downtime**: Implement a proactive maintenance schedule, addressing issues before they cause system failures.
- **Cost optimization**: Avoid unnecessary preventive maintenance and costly emergency repairs by maintaining the right balance between cost and uptime.
